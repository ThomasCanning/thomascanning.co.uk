    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Driven by a passion for technology, mathematics, machine learning, and finance, I am a Computer Science student studying at the University of Bath with a strong interest in pursuing a career in quantitative finance.
      Currently honing my programming and problem-solving skills as a Software Engineer at Confluent during my year in industry, I am eager to apply my skills and gain further experience in quantitative finance through an internship in the summer of 2025.</p>

            CalKeeper is the comprehensive solution for helping UK electricians maintain accurate and up-to-date records of their electrical test instruments. Electrical test instruments must be calibrated every 3 years, and up-to-date records must be kept each month to ensure the instrument remains within calibration tolerance. With CalKeeper, electricians can:
            <ul>
              <li>Record instrument insulation, continuity, earth loop, and RCD values, with the flexibility to enter as much or as little detail as needed.</li>
              <li>Export reports for each instrument to PDF at the tap of a button.</li>
              <li>Receive automatic alerts if values deviate from baseline readings.</li>
              <li>Stay on top of testing with notifications for upcoming instrument tests.</li>
              <li>Get started easily with tutorial prompts guiding setup.</li>
            </ul>
            The app is built in Flutter, with data stored on the device using Hive. This is my first mobile app released to an app store, and it has taught me a great deal about mobile app design and the process of public release. The app is currently under review on the Google Play Store.

            This tool calculates the price of European call and put options, using either the Black-Scholes formula or the binomial pricing model. The models are based on the book "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John C. Hull (5th edition). Additionally, you can plot each variable against the options call or put price to visualize the impact of each variable on the option price.
            The app is built in Python, with a Tkinter GUI. The binomial pricing model uses numpy for calculations, and the graphs are plotted with matplotlib. The project was a great way of improving my understanding of option pricing models, and the mathematics behind them.

            Amaze is a visualisation tool for graph search algorithms. You are given a 25 by 25 grid and can create a maze of wall pieces with a start and end tile. You are then able to select a pathfinding algorithm (A*, depth first search, breadth first search, or random search) and display the path it finds. You can also choose to display all the nodes that the algorithm visits in the process of finding the path. This allows you to compare the path found by different algorithms, as well as see a rough time comparison for the time it takes to run. You can also save your created maze so it will be there next time the programme runs. This was a very useful project for understanding how graph search algorithms work.

            This is a classical hangman game - guess the word without too many incorrect guesses or the man gets hung. In single-player, the word is a country, selected randomly from a text fil, the player has 6 guesses to guess the word, with each incorrect guess brining the man 1 step closer to being hung. Try to beat your highscore, which the game keeps track of by writing to a local file. There is also multiplayer mode, where players alternate between picking and guessing a word. I learnt lots about Java and developing a GUI in this project.

          I first read <em>"Quantitative Finance For Dummies" by Steve Bell</em> to explore some of the key concepts in quantitative finance. Currently, I'm working through <em>"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull</em>, to gain a deeper understanding in some areas such as modelling stock price behavior and option pricing models. I've applied this knowledge through working through the exercises in the book, and implementing option pricing theories in a Python calculator and visualization tool.</div>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3 id="confluent-internship"><strong>Software Engineering Internship</strong> - Confluent (05/2024 - 05/2025)</h3>
    <p>I am currently on a software engineering internship at Confluent, working as a cloud infrastructure engineer within the Kubernetes platform team –
      the team that manages the Kubernetes clusters that run Confluent Cloud, a Kafka-based real-time data streaming service.
      I’ve gained hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Golang, Linux and Git commands, Terraform, AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, and Helm, by delivering several projects, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing Datadog metric cardinality, resulting in approximately $30,000/month savings.</li>
      <li>Resolving an Azure Storage Accounts quota monitoring issue by creating new metrics and unit tests using Go.</li>
      <li>Migrating several internal app installations from Terraform to Flux using Helm charts and kubectl.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="gapAbove"><strong>Peer Assisted Learning Leader</strong> - University of Bath (09/2023 - 05/2024)</h3>
    <p class="gapUnder">I volunteered to lead multiple tutorial-style sessions per week, as part of a team, to the 1st year Computer Science cohort, recapping all the material learnt in lectures, getting regular experience presenting to a large group, alongside keeping the Computer Science content I learnt in 1st year fresh in my memory.</p>
    <h3><strong>Outdoor Activities Instructor</strong> - Hautbois Activity Centre (04/2022 - 05/2024)</h3>
    <p>I led a variety of outdoor activities to groups of young people, taking responsibility over
      participants and instructing enthusiastically to the highest standards, encouraging teamwork
      amongst groups, and often working collaboratively with other instructors.
