  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Driven by a passion for technology, mathematics, machine learning, and finance, I am a Computer Science student studying at the University of Bath with a strong interest in pursuing a career in quantitative finance.
    Currently honing my programming and problem-solving skills as a Software Engineer at Confluent during my year in industry, I am eager to apply my skills and gain further experience in quantitative finance through an internship in the summer of 2025.</p>

  <h3><strong>BSc Computer Science with Year in Industry</strong> - University of Bath (09/2022 - 06/2026)</h3>


  <details>
    <summary><h4 id="year2-header">2nd year modules | 81% average ▸ </h4></summary>
    <div id="year2-content">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine learning</strong>: 85% – Studied neural networks (including convolutional, GANs, large-language models), and other supervised/unsupervised techniques such as regression, Naive-Bayes, PCA, and Gaussian Mixture Models - implementing each in Python.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>: 85% – Learnt about the mathematics behind sorting, hash tables, graphs, and trees, data collections, and cryptography, with a focus on proving the correctness of the algorithms, and determining their complexity, alongside implementing each in Java.</li>
        <li><strong>Experimental Systems Project</strong>: 73% – Took a racket-sports matchmaking app concept through the entire software engineering lifecycle in a team of 8, from requirements design, to agile development, testing, and evaluation, ultimately producing a React-mobile app.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundations of Computation</strong>: 84% – Explored the theoretical aspects of computation, including deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata, regular and context-free languages, Turing machines, and the Church-Turing thesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparative Programming Languages</strong>: 93% – Discussed the question "How do you pick the right programming language", by comparing concepts such as types, compilers, memory management, programming paradigms, and object-oriented programming. </li>
        <li><strong>Fundamentals of Visual Computing</strong>: 89% – Investigated visual computing concepts from image filtering, the Fourier Transform, and lighting models, to curves, and textures rendering, and then implementing these concepts in Python.</li>
        <li><strong>Functional Programming</strong>: 63% –  Studied lambda calculus, the theoretical foundation of functional programming, and applied these principles to programming in Haskell.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-Computer Interaction and User-Experience</strong>: 81% – Applied HCI and user-experience theories to design a VR "Lego Builder" app, working in a group to develop low and high-fidelity prototypes, conduct user testing, and perform statistical analysis on the data.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <details>
    <summary><h4 id="year1-header">1st year modules | 77% average ▸</h4></summary>
    <div id="year1-content">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Processes and Modelling</strong>: 77% – Led a team of 5 as Scrum Master in developing a fitness app. I led the development of the Java frontend, organised meetings, and learnt how software projects can be effectively organised using agile development and object-oriented programming.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematics for Computation</strong>: 78% – Studied fundamental topics in mathematical analysis crucial to Computer Science, including linear algebra, derivatives, and series.</li>
        <li><strong>Principles of Programming</strong>: 79% – Gained the skills to quickly pick up and solve problems in any language. I became proficient in Python and Java, and explored memory management with C.</li>
        <li><strong>Discrete Mathematics and Databases</strong>: 82% – Developed knowledge of logic, maps, and relational algebra, then applied it to databases and SQL.</li>
        <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>: 69% – Explored a broad range of AI concepts, from search techniques and constraint satisfaction, to probability and machine learning. I used Python to implement each concept, with a focus on writing fast code, and was inspired to explore deep learning beyond the unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Systems Architecture</strong>: 79% – Gained a deeper understanding of how computers work at varying levels of abstraction, focusing on logic, hardware, and data representation, which was put into practise with group Arduino projects using C++, while semester 2 focused on operating systems and networks.</li>
      </ul>
